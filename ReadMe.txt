Hello.
Thank you for looking at my GitHub Repo folder for my Project.
I would like to note that my Python Jupyter Source File is all that you need to replicate my work. 
I was not able to upload all of the model files here due to GitHub preventing me based on size limitations. 

The Final_Project file is all you need as it documents the code ran, comments on my project structure, and Huggingface resources I utilized.

I also have a summary document typed in IEEE formatting here in PDF format which you can read for a quick summary of the project and results of finetuning models.
